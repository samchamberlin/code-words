CODE WORDS - MATLAB Version
Author: Sam Chamberlin
Date: December 13, 2018

This game is a virtual version of the popular "Code Names" created by Vlaada Chvatil.

This is a multiplayer game that requires 4+ players. The players separate 
into two teams, Red and Blue. Each team chooses a team captain to be the
hint giver. The captains take a picture of the Answer Board that reveals
which words are connected to their respective teams. Then the captains hide
the Answer Board so that the other players can't see the answers. Whenever 
the blue team captain is ready, he may give a one-word hint as well as the 
number of words he is connecting. He is attempting to connect as many blue 
words as he can with a single one-word hint. The players guess one word at 
a time. Once a word has been guessed, the captain of that team will then
click the word, revealing the word's true color. If it was indeed a blue 
word then the blue team may continue guessing until they have guessed all 
of the words that the blue captain was trying to connect. They have one 
minute to guess. After that minute has passed, it switches to the red
team's turn. Their turn follows the same. If a team guesses a brown word or
a word for the other team, then their turn ends immediately. If either team
guesses the black word, then they lose. First team to guess successfully all of
their code words wins!
